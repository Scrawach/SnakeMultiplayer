## Deploy

### Docker

> [!WARNING]
> Required [docker](https://docker-docs.uclv.cu/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docker-docs.uclv.cu/compose/install/).

cd server
```

2. Start container:

docker-compose up
```

That's all. Now you have a container running on your machine with a server for the game on port `2567`. If this port is busy, there will be problems, so you can change it in the corresponding [docker compose file](https://github.com/Scrawach/SnakeMultiplayer/blob/main/server/docker-compose.yml).

### NPM

1. Go to server folder with sorce code:

```
cd server/SnakeMultiplayerServer
```

2. Install dependecies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start server:

That's all. Now you can start the game client and connect to the game.
